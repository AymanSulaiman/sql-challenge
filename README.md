# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Background

In this challenge, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. I will be doing:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

#### Data Modeling 

I inspected the csv files and created an ERD with `quickdatabasediagrams.com` to visualise the process.

#### Data Engineering 

I have used the information that I have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and created a relational database with those six csv files.

#### Data Analysis
I did the following the analysis:

1. I listed the details of each employee under: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. Listed employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Listed all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, I listed the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

9. Importing the SQL database into Pandas and used SQLAlchemy 

10. Created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

11. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

12. I wanted to know who the ID number (499942) belonged to.
